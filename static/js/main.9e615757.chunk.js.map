They are called Homunculi and use the crest of the dragon swallowing itself as their embelem.\r\n             \r\n             <br/><br/>\r\n             Aside from the primary emotion/desire they embody, Homunculi generally possess the belief that they are superior \r\n             to every other living thing, including humans. This is the psychological effect of their\r\n              being born with immense strengths. Many of the Homunculi even have ill feelings towards humans.\r\n               Out of the Homunculi, the sadistic Envy is the one who hates and treats them the most\r\n                personally and with utmost bitterness, while Pride has the evilest malice, disdain, \r\n                discrimination, prejudice and contempt towards humans. Greed is the only Homunculus \r\n                that does not openly hate humans in any respect\r\n\r\n\r\n                <br/><br/>\r\n             The Homunculi were created by injecting a Philosopher's Stone (imbued with one of Father's seven basic vices) broken off from \r\n             Father's own Philosopher's Stone, into the body of a living being. Five of the Homunculi\r\n              are based on (and have exactly the same composition as) humans, which were either \r\n              artificial bodies transmuted from Father or naturally occurring humans; Envy is based\r\n               on a disturbing leviathan creature created by Father; and Pride is created from\r\n                Father's own semi-divine essence, being, and image. If the Homunculus is based on \r\n                a natural person (like with Wrath and the Second Greed), the stone and the body of \r\n                the human clash until one overcomes the other. Most often than not, the stone wins,\r\n                 and the human dies, though sometimes the human wins.\r\n             </p>\r\n         </div>\r\n         <div>\r\n             <img className='img-responsive'src={antagonist} style={{width:'850px'}}></img>\r\n         </div>\r\n        \r\n     </div>\r\n\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Page5;","import $ from 'jquery';\r\nimport './App.css';\r\nimport React,{useEffect} from 'react'\r\nimport Landing from './components/Landing/Landing';\r\nimport About from './components/2ndpage/About';\r\nimport Page4 from './components/4thpage/4thpage';\r\nimport Page3 from './components/3rdPage/3rdPage';\r\nimport Page5 from './components/5thpage/5thpage'\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  useEffect(()=>{\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function() {\r\n      window.$('#container-horizontal').pagepiling({\r\n          menu: null,\r\n            direction: 'horizontal',\r\n            verticalCentered: true,\r\n            sectionsColor: [],\r\n            anchors: [],\r\n            scrollingSpeed: 700,\r\n            easing: 'swing',\r\n            loopBottom: false,\r\n            loopTop: false,\r\n            css3: true,\r\n            navigation: {\r\n                'textColor': '#000',\r\n                'bulletsColor': '#FF0000',\r\n                'position': 'right',\r\n                'tooltips': ['section1', 'section2', 'section3', 'section4']\r\n            },\r\n             normalScrollElements: null,\r\n            normalScrollElementTouchThreshold: 5,\r\n            touchSensitivity: 5,\r\n            keyboardScrolling: true,\r\n            sectionSelector: '.section',\r\n            animateAnchor: false,\r\n    \r\n        //events\r\n        onLeave: function(index, nextIndex, direction){},\r\n        afterLoad: function(anchorLink, index){},\r\n        afterRender: function(){},\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n\r\n  },[])\r\n  return (\r\n    <div id=\"container-horizontal\">\r\n\r\n      <div class='section'>\r\n      <Landing/>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <div class='section'>\r\n        <About/>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class='section'>\r\n        <Page3/>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class='section'>\r\n        <Page4/>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class='section'>\r\n        <Page5/>\r\n      </div>\r\n      {/* <div class='section'>testing</div> */}\r\n \r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nimport './index.css';\r\nimport App from './App';\r\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n  <React.StrictMode>\r\n    <App />\r\n  </React.StrictMode>,\r\n  document.getElementById('root')\r\n);\r\n \r\n\r\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\r\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\r\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
